## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a bitmap library that lets you create, draw to
and save an int buffer or [MinilibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux)
image as a `.bmp` file.

It also helps you create switch between different representations of colors
like `int` and individual red, green, blue and transparency `char`s.

I've used it in the following projects:

- https://github.com/librity/ft_fractol
- https://github.com/librity/ft_minirt

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

All you need is a C compiler (`gcc` or `clang`).
The make rule opens the example file with
[`ffplay`](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html),
so it's nice to have.

### üñ•Ô∏è Installing

Clone the repo and build with `make`:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/librity/ft_libbmp.git
$ cd ft_libbmp
$ make example
```

The image of a beautiful gradient should open in a new window.

## üìù Notes <a name = "notes"></a>

I know you can write the magic bits as a `short` using `# pragma pack(push, 1)`.
I didn't do it for two reasons:

1. I'm getting the norminette error: `Unrecognized preprocessor statement`
2. It's clearer this way.

## üõ∏ 42 S√£o Paulo <a name = "ft_sp"></a>

Part of the larger [42 Network](https://www.42.fr/42-network/),
[42 S√£o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/) is a software engineering school
that offers a healthy alternative to traditional education:

- It doesn't have any teachers and classes.
- Students learn by cooperating
  and correcting each other's work (peer-to-peer learning).
- Its focus is as much on social skills as it is on technical skills.
- It's completely free to anyone that passes its selection process -
  [**The Piscine**](https://42.fr/en/admissions/42-piscine/)

It's an amazing school, and I'm grateful for the opportunity.
